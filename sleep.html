	<h2>sleep</h2>
			<p>Sleep is the most important aspect of improving at the gym and improving your mental health.</p>
			<p>Sleep does wonderful things not just in your brain, it improves the health of your muscles.</p>
			<p>Getting enough sleep helps your brain give that supporting hand when in the gym.</p>
<p>Getting enough sleep can help you feel more awake and be more effective during the day. It also helps improve your mental health.,/p>
<p>While you are asleep your body repairs the damaged tissue created while working out. It creates the hormone (HGH) that helps repair the muscle and helps it grow. If you are not getting enough sleep it slows down the recovery process.</p>
<p>Sleep plays a huge role with your health and your wellbeing. The way you feel during the day depends on how you are sleeping. For teens it helps the growth and development of their body and mind. Not getting enough sleep might increase long term chronic effects.</p>
