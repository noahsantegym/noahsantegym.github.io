	<h2>DIET FOR MUSCLE GAIN</h2>
			<p>Diet is one of the most important parts of your wellbeing and fitness journey. Diet helps the body stay energised and lets the brain have enough fuel to do day to day activities.</p>
			<p>Sorting out what times are best to eat and how much you should be eating will help you stay on top of your diet.</p>

		<h2>CALORIES</h2>
			<p>The first step is to determine what is the set of calories that is appropriate to your body composition.</p>
			<p>The second step is to figure out what times are best to eat.</p>
<p>The exact amount of calories you need for muscle gain is strongly affected by the amount of exercise you do a week.</p>
<p>If you need up to 2500 calories a day to maintain muscle mass you might need to increase it by 250 or 300 calories. For many, increasing your calorie intake by 5/10% is most efficient in growing muscle. For some it's up to their body compositions and level of training.</p>

			<h2>EXERCISES</h2>
			<p>The amount of exercise you should be doing is dependent on what you are looking for.</p>
<p>If you spend an hour a day, three days a week at the gym that is fine, if you do more or less that it is okay too.</p>
		<p>Being consistent and hitting the right muscle groups can help you grow.</p>
<p>For building muscle mass you need to focus more on form than how much you are lifting. Lifting a large amount may look cool but perfecting your form is more crucial to grow.</p>
